I'm a 23 years old SysAdmin/DevOps based in Italy with the passion for IT systems and coding.
Moving across servers, code, and deployments, I started working as a professional in 2016 gaining and maturing experience day-by-day,
always looking for new technologies and methods.

Experienced and certified by VMware on virtualization technologies and skilled in Microsoft/Linux environments. 

You can see my full resume [here](https://mattups.github.io/resume/).

But... Life isn't all about code and shells! I also love music, drawing, literature, sculpting and everything that's Art.
